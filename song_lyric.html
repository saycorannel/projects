			<p>
			There's no reason, there's no rhyme<br/>
			I found myself blindsided by<br/>
			A feeling that I've never known<br/>
			I'm dealing with it on my own<br/>
			Phone is quiet, walls are bare<br/>
			I drink myself to sleep, who cares?<br/>
			No one even has to know<br/>
			I'm dealing with it on my own
			</p>
			<p>
			I got way too much time to be this hurt<br/>
			Somebody help, it's getting worse<br/>
			What do you do with a broken heart?<br/>
			Once the light fades, everything is dark<br/>
			Way too much whiskey in my blood<br/>
			I feel my body giving up<br/>
			Can I hold on for another night?<br/>
			What do I do with all this time?
			</p>
			<p>
			Every thought's when it gets late<br/>
			Put me in a fragile state<br/>
			I wish I wasn't going home<br/>
			Dealing with it on my own<br/>
			I'm praying but it's not enough<br/>
			I'm done, I don't believe in love<br/>
			Learning how to let it go<br/>
			Dealing with it on my own
			</p>
			<p>
			I got way too much time to be this hurt<br/>
			Somebody help, it's getting worse<br/>
			What do you do with a broken heart?<br/>
			Once the light fades, everything is dark<br/>
			Way too much whiskey in my blood<br/>
			I feel my body giving up<br/>
			Can I hold on for another night?<br/>
			What do I do with all this time? Yeah
			</p>
			<p>
			I drive circles under street lights<br/>
			Nothing seems to clear my mind<br/>
			I can't forget<br/>
			It's inside my head, so<br/>
			I drive, chasing Malibu nights<br/>
			Nothing seems to heal my mind<br/>
			I can't forget
			</p>
			<p>
			I got way too much time to be this hurt<br/>
			Somebody help, it's getting worse<br/>
			What do you do with a broken heart?<br/>
			Once the light fades, everything is dark<br/>
			Way too much whiskey in my blood<br/>
			I feel my body giving up<br/>
			Can I hold on for another night?<br/>
			What do I do with all this time? Yeah
			</p>
			<p>
			I drive circles under street lights<br/>
			Nothing seems to clear my mind<br/>
			I can't forget<br/>
			It's inside my head, so<br/>
			I drive, chasing Malibu nights<br/>
			Nothing seems to heal my mind<br/>
			I can't forget<br/>
			(It's inside my head, so)<br/>
			I drive, chasing Malibu nights<br/>	
			Hey, hey, na-na
